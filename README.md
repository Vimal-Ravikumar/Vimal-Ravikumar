## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on honing my skills in data analysis through personal projects and online courses. Specifically, I'm diving deeper into techniques such as 
  exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms. I am eager to apply what I learn to real-world problems and contribute positively to the data science 
  local area.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning on mastering python for data analysis, including libraries like pandas and NumPy, as well as data visualization tools such as Matplotlib 
  and seaborn.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data driven projects where I can contribute my skills in data analysis and visualzation.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with expanding my knowledge in areas such as advanced machine learning techniques, deep learning, and big data technologies.
